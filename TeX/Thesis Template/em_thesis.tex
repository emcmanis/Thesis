The Yukawa potential describes a force mediated by a massive particle. It is %argh fuck this part
\eqn{
V(r) = -\frac{C}{r}e^{-r/l}\mbox{,}
}
where $C$ and $l$ are constants. $C$ sets the strength of the force; $l$ acts as a length scale. The exponential term provides an effective cutoff once $r$ gets much larger than $l$, as the exponential term drops off quite rapidly. We are interested in how the bound states change with these constants. 

The force described by the potential comes from the exchange of virtual particles. The lenth scale, which limits the range at which the force acts, comes about because the virtual particles exchanged have mass. The mass of these particles then generates the length scale:
\eqn{
l = \frac{\hbar}{m_{\pi}c}\mbox{.}
}
The strength of the force $C$ is only known experimentally and depends on the application of the potential. Most commonly, this is the forces between protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus.

In general, the time-independent Schr\"odinger wave equation for a particle under the influence of some $V(r)$ is
\eqn{
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2\psi(r,\phi,\theta) + V(r)\psi (r,\phi,\theta) = E \psi(r,\phi,\theta)
\label{eq:TIDSWE-general}
}
In this thesis, we are working with a system of two particles moving under the influence of the Yukawa potential (in the atomic case, this would be a deuterium nucleus). To simplify the system, it makes the most sense to express this in spherical coordinates as a reduced mass orbiting a center of mass. This is the form used for the wave equation above. With the Yukawa potential, this equation cannot be solved analytically. However, we can solve the more simple system described by the potential without the exponential term, that is,
\eqn{
 V(r) = -\frac{C}{r}\mbox{.}
 }
This potential is the same form as the Coulomb potential in the hydrogen atom. With the Coulomb potential, $C = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0}$. While $r << l$, the Yukawa potential should behave similarly to this, because the $-C/r$ term will dominate. Therefore, we will gain some insight on the Yukawa potential by solving the wave equation for this one.
The solution to this wave equation is well known:
\eqn{
\psi_{l, m_l, n} (r, \theta, \phi) = R_{n,l}(r) Y_{l,m_l}(\theta,\phi)\mbox{.}
}
Here, $l$, $m_l$, and $n$ are quantum numbers. The $Y_{l, m_l}$ are the spherical harmonics. As we are currently interested only in spherically symmetric solutions, we can discard these for the moment, leaving us with
\eqn{
\psi_{n, l =0}(r) = R_{n , l= 0}(r) = e^{-C \mu r / n \hbar^2}\left(\frac{C \mu r}{\hbar^2}\right)^{l} G_{n, l = 0}\left(\frac{C \mu r}{\hbar^2}\right)
\label{eq:SWE-coulomb}
}
The $G_{n,l}$ here is related to the Laguerre polynomials:
\eqn{
G_{n,l}\left(\frac{C \mu r}{\hbar^2}\right) = L^{2l + 1 }_{n- l -1} \left(2\frac{C \mu r}{\hbar^2}\right)\mbox{.}
}
The energy for the particle described by this wave function is just a function of $n$ (the radial quantum number), and is equal to
\eqn{
E_n = -\frac{\mu C^2}{2\hbar^2 n^2}\mbox{.}
}
All of these functions can be simplified further by introducing a length scale, 
\eqn{
\alpha = \frac{\hbar^2}{C \mu}\mbox{.}
\label{eq:bohrradius}
}
$\alpha$ is a constant with units of length, defined in terms of the other constants of the problem. In hydrogen, this is the Bohr radius, and reduces to the familiar $a_o = \frac{4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar^2}{\mu e^2}$. Physically, $\alpha$ is the length scale of the exponential term in the ground state of \eqref{eq:SWE-coulomb}. In hydrogen, this determines the size of the smallest electron cloud. As $n$ increases, so do the possible values of $r$, and the particle can be found further and further from the center of mass of the system. This can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hfuncs}, in which $\psi(r)^2$ (the probability density function obtained from $\psi(r)$) is plotted for several values of $n$.
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{densityplots.png}
\caption{The first six spherically symmetric wave functions. $\psi(\rho)^2$ was plotted, where $\rho = \frac{r}{\alpha}$ is the nondimensionalized radial coordinate.}
\label{fig:hfuncs}
\end{figure}
As this happens, $E_n$ gets closer and closer to zero, but never quite reaches it -- there are an infinite number of bound states possible. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:hspec}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{hydrogenspectrum.png}
\caption{The energies of the first 10 bound states of the electron in the hydrogen atom}
\label{fig:hspec}
\end{figure}

Going back to the more-complicated Yukawa potential, the exponential term in the potential means that its range is limited in a way the Coulomb potential's isn't, because $e^{-x}$ drops off much faster than $1/x$. We expect that this will limit the number of bound states as well, to some number whose $r$s are less than $l$.

\chapter{Semi-Classical Approximation}
\section{The Bohr Model}
The similarity between the Yukawa potential in deuterium and the Coulomb potential in hydrogen suggests treating them similarly. The Bohr model is a semi-classical view of the electron orbiting the nucleus in hydrogen. The postulates of the model are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Electrons move in circular orbits around the nucleus under the influence of the Coulomb force. They obey all the laws of classical mechanics.
\item Angular momentum is quantized; $L = n\hbar$ where $n$ is a positive integer.
\item The energy of the electron in an orbit remains constant.
\end{enumerate}
We can easily use this model with the Yukawa potential instead of the Coulomb to get a qualitative idea of where we expect bound states to be found.

First, we look at the classical energy of a particle (here, the reduced mass of the neutron-proton system) moving under the influence of the Yukawa potential:
\eqn{
E = \frac{1}{2}\mu \dot{r}^2+\frac{1}{2}\frac{L^2}{\mu r^2}-\frac{C}{r}e^{-r/l}\mbox{.}
\label{eq:classical-energy}
}
To make this easier to work with, we use the length scale from \eqref{eq:bohrradius}, the ``Bohr radius'' for this problem. We then use this to nondimensionalize $r$, defining
\begin{equation}
\rho \equiv \frac{r}{\alpha}\mbox{.}
\label{eq:rho}
\end{equation}
Finally, we define a time scale:
\begin{equation}
\beta \equiv \frac{c^2m}{\hbar^3}\mbox{.}
\label{eq:beta}
\end{equation}

We can now substitute in $\rho$, $\alpha$, and $\tau = \beta t$:
\begin{align}
E &= \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{d\rho}{d \tau}\alpha \beta\right)^2+\frac{1}{2}\frac{c}{\rho^2 \alpha}(n^2-\rho e^{-(\rho \alpha)/l}) \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\frac{c}{\alpha}\rho'^2 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{c}{\alpha}\frac{1}{\rho^2}(n^2-\rho e^{-(\rho \alpha)/l}) \\
\frac{2\alpha}{c}E = \tilde{E} &= \rho'^2 +\frac{1}{\rho^2}(n^2 - 2\rho e^{-\rho/ \lambda})
\end{align}
In the last line, we have used $\lambda = \frac{l}{\alpha}$, relating the strength of the force and the length scale of the problem. 
We now have a dimensionless effective potential,
\begin{equation}
V_{eff}=\frac{1}{\rho^2}(n^2- 2\rho e^{-\rho/\lambda})
\label{veff}
\end{equation}
to use for further analysis.

We now turn our attention to the number of bound states allowed by this potential. We expect that the exponential term will act as a cutoff, limiting the number of bound states to some finite quantity. As a really naive approximation of this behavior, we can use the Bohr model to look at a system where $V(r) = -\frac{C}{r}$ for $r < $l, and $V(r) = 0$ everywhere else.

This system is equivalent to hydrogen for $r<l$, so we solve it the same way. We know that
\eqn{
\frac{C}{r^2} = F = \mu a = \mu \frac{v^2}{r}
}
and 
\eqn{
\mu v r = n\hbar
}
from the postulates. Solving for $v$ and substituting, we find that
\eqn{
r = \frac{n^2 \hbar^2}{\mu C}
}
Substituting in our length scale gets us 
\eqn{
r = n^2 \alpha \mbox{.}
}
The physical interpretation of $\alpha$ is clear here -- in the ground state ($n = 1$), $r = \alpha$. Substituting our nondimensionalized $\rho$ makes the expression even simpler: we get
\eqn{
\rho = n^2\mbox{.}
}
This can be rearranged to be $n = \sqrt{\rho}$. For some $\lambda$, then, there will be $\lfloor \sqrt{\lambda} \rfloor$ bound states, and a new bound state will appear when $\sqrt{\lambda} = n$.

To perform the analysis of the full potential, we look at the graph of the effective potential (figure [placeholder]%\ref{fig:veff}
). 
We can see that bound states exist for $\rho$ where $V_{eff}$ is less than 0, and these bound states have circular orbits at the minimum of $V_{eff}$ Keeping $\alpha$ and $n$ constant, there will then be two critical values of $\lambda$ -- one where $V_{eff}$ has no more true bound states, and one where $V_{eff}$ doesn't produce any kind of dip.

The first of these critical values occurs when the minimum of $V_{eff}$ is 0. To find it, we start by taking the derivative of \eqref{veff} and setting it to 0, obtaining
\begin{align}
\frac{dV}{d\rho_0} &= -\frac{2n^2}{\rho_0^3} + \frac{2}{\rho_0^2}e^{-\rho_0/\lambda} + \frac{2}{\rho_0 \lambda} e^{-\rho_0/\lambda} \\
0 &= -2n^2 + 2\rho_0 e^{-\rho_0/\lambda} + 2\frac{\rho_0^2}{\lambda} e^{-\rho_0/\lambda}
\label{vmin}
\end{align}
where $\rho_0$ is the value of $\rho$ when $V_{eff}$ is minimized. This equation has no general solution, but we can find one for the specific case where $V_{eff}(\rho_0) = 0$ by solving the equation
\begin{align}
V_{eff}(\rho_0)=0 &= n^2 - 2\rho_0 e^{-\rho_0/\lambda} \\
n^2 &= 2 \rho_0 e^{-\rho_0/\lambda}
\end{align}
and plugging it in to the previous, obtaining
\begin{align}
0 &= -2n^2 + n^2 +n^2 \frac{\rho_0}{\lambda} \\
&= -1 + \frac{\rho_0}{\lambda} \\
\rho_0 &= \lambda \mbox{.}
\end{align}
Plugging this back into the equation for $V_{eff}(\rho_0)$ gives us
\begin{equation}
\mbox{$n = \sqrt{\frac{2}{e}}\sqrt{\lambda} \approx 0.857764\sqrt{\lambda}$}
\end{equation}
which is pretty close to the naive $n = \sqrt{\lambda}$ from above. 

For the second critical point, the one where $V_{eff}$ has no minimum, we rewrite \eqref{vmin} to be
\begin{equation}
n^2 = \left( \rho + \frac{\rho^2}{\lambda} \right) e^{-\rho/\lambda}
\end{equation}
The right side of this equation will have some maximum, which will be the last point for which the equation can be solved -- after that, the value of $n^2$ will always be greater than the right side. To find this, we differentiate with respect to $\rho$ and set to 0, obtaining
\begin{align}
0 &= (1+2 \frac{\rho}{\lambda}) - \frac{1}{\lambda}(\rho + \frac{\rho^2}{\lambda}) \\
&= 1 + \frac{\rho}{\lambda} + \frac{\rho^2}{\lambda^2}\mbox{.}
\end{align}
This is a quadratic in $\rho$ and can be solved using the quadratic formula:
\begin{align}
\rho &= \frac{-\frac{1}{\lambda} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)^2+4\frac{1}{\lambda^2}}}{-\frac{2}{\lambda^2}} \\
&= \frac{\lambda}{2} \mp \frac{\lambda \sqrt{5}}{2}
\end{align}
As $\rho$ is a real physical quantity that can't be negative, we can discard one solution, obtaining
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{2}(1+\sqrt{5})
\end{equation}
We can plug this in to \eqref{vmin} to find the relationship between $\lambda$ and $n$:
\begin{align}
n^2 &= \lambda(1+\sqrt{5})\left(\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{4}\right)e^{-(1+\sqrt{5})/2} \\
n &= 0.916494 \sqrt{\lambda}
\end{align}
From these equations, we expect the number of bound states to go up as the square root of $\lambda$.

\chapter{Numerical Methods and Spherically Symmetric Results}

\section{The Hamiltonian}

In the previous chapter, we analytically obtained an estimate for the number of bound states allowed by the Yukawa potential given $\lambda$. We now turn our attention to the Schroedinger Wave Equation in order to numerically determine the critical values of $\lambda$ at which a new bound state appears. 

The Wave Equation can be written as
\eqn{
H \psi = E\psi
\label{eq:hamiltonian}
}
where $H$ is the Hamiltonian operator, $H =-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 +V$.  Because we are focusing on spherically symmetric bound states, we are only concerned about the $r$ component of the $\nabla$ operator. Equation \eqref{eq:hamiltonian} then becomes
\eqn{
H = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \left[\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2 \frac{d}{dr}\right)\right] - \frac{C}{r}e^{-r/l}\mbox{,}
}
plugging in the Yukawa potential for $V$.

Using the same nondimensionalizations as in last chapter, we rewrite this as 
\eqn{
H=\frac{C}{2\alpha}\tilde{H} = \frac{c}{2\alpha} \left[- \frac{1}{\rho^2}\frac{d}{d\rho}\left(\rho^2\frac{d}{d\rho}\right) - \frac{2}{\rho}e^{-\rho/\lambda}\right]\mbox{.}
\label{eq:hnondim}
}
The constant out front is the same one we pulled when we nondimensionalized the energy of the system, which allows us to restate \eqref{eq:hamiltonian} as
\eqn{
\tilde{H}\psi = \tilde{E}\psi\mbox{.}
}
To simplify, we can substitute \footnote{I should have a cite here.} $u(\rho)=\rho \phi(\rho)$ into the expression in \eqref{eq:hnondim}. This gives us a much neater Hamiltonian, and our differential equation is now
\eqn{
\frac{d^2 u }{d \rho^2} - \frac{2}{\rho}e^{-\rho/\lambda}u = E u\mbox{.}
\label{eq:hamiltonianfinal}
}
